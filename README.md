MERN CRUD Application

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) application. It has been designed to work with Github repositories and create a readme file.


Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:



Node.js 

MongoDB 

React 


Setting Up


Clone the repository from Github.

Run npm install in the root folder to install all the required dependencies.

Create a .env file and add your MongoDB connection string and other environment variables.

Run npm start to start the server.


The App

The application has two main components: a front-end React app and a back-end Node/Express server. The React app is responsible for displaying the user interface and making AJAX requests to the server. The Node/Express server is responsible for serving the API endpoints and connecting to the MongoDB database.


API Endpoints

The API endpoints are as follows:



GET /api/items: Retrieves all the items

POST /api/items: Creates an item

PUT /api/items/:id: Updates an item

DELETE /api/items/:id: Deletes an item


Readme File

At the root of the repository is a Readme file which describes the project and provides instructions on how to set up and run the application.


Conclusion

This MERN CRUD application is a great way to get up and running with a modern web development stack. It can be used as a starting point for any project that needs to store and manipulate data in a database.
